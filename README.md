### Hi there! I'm Samantha!
I am a Full-Stack Developer who graduated the Boise Codeworks program. During this program, I obtained 500+ hours of hands-on and classroom lectures where learned a vast skill-set including how to write clean and efficient code as well as how to code professionally on a team with other developers. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about clean code. To do this, I'm reading Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin

- Fun facts: 
    - 🌛 I currently live in Boise, Idaho with my significant other and our dog, Luna. We are always looking for adventure and are willing to relocate to new places.
    - 🎲 I love to play and design games (analog and digital)! 
    - 📚 I love to read books!
    - ✨ My favorite DnD class is a Warlock
